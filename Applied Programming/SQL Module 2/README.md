# Overview

This is a basic SQL project to allow the user to manage a database easily, I made this program to showcase my knowledge of both SQL and Python

This software has a menu to help manage a database of employees and it helps make it user friendly to find information about each employee in the database

I created this software for the ease of manipulating a database for the user.
