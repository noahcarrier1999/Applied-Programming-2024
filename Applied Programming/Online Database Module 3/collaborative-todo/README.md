# Overview
This is a basic Java Script Express server app that connects to an online mongoDb database and allows a user to Create, Read, Update and Delete items of a todo list, I made this to showcase my knowledge of Express, Createing a server and connecting it to MongoDb.

This software has a simple index.html menu and a easy GUI to help a user to manage a mongoDB database. It allows a user to keep track of to do items to help them be productive.

I created this software for the ease of manipulating a MongoDb database for the user.
