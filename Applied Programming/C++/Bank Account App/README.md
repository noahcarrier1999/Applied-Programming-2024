# Overview

This is a portfolio that shows the work that I have done to learn C++ and the proof of the knowledge gained by making a Bank Account application.This helps a user simply manage different accounts all in one place

This software allows the user to add accounts and keep track of the accounts by allowing them to add funds or withdraw fund to many accounts.

I created this software to have a simple way of keeping track of accounts and to also show that I understand C++ and can implement many different aspects of C++.
